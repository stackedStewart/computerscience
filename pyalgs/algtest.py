#Create an integer variable for x
x = 0
#Create an integer variable for y
y = 0
#Create an integer variable for sum
sum = 0

#Ask user for integer input into ("X: ") and type answer in
x = int(input("X: "))
#Ask user for integer input into ("Y: ") and type answer in
y = int(input("Y: "))

#Sum will equal the two integers of x + y together
sum = x + y

#Will print out the answer with ("Answer is: ")
print("Answer is: ")
print(sum)
##print(x + y)
